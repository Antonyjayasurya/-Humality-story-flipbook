			I WAS UNCONSCIOUS IN A DARK FOREST<br><br>

          A day morning, it's a sunny theme ,in the middle of the
          forest, a tree was smashed, one tiny little sparrow, flying
          over the tree and to the ground, there the bike parts was
          broken down over the ground..(in a smooth action).<br>

                      <br> FIRST PAGE OF HUMALITY <br>

          <br> I OPENED MY EYES SLOWLY,THE VISION WAS BLUR<br>

          <br >i slowly opened my eye (slowly),my eye vision was blur,i
          started to refresh my mind, i sawed my surrounding was
          covered with trees, i understood that i was in a forest, i
          suddenly got a pain on my head and when i touch my head,<br><br> my
          hair and beard grown long,i understood that i was here for
          long time, i don't know what happened to my head. and it
          surprised me when i tried to imagine my face....<br><br>i forgot my
          face how my face look like, i forgot my name, i forgot
          entire past, i don't even recognize my parents. the only
          thing i could recognize was my finger point at a two persons
          and a lady sound which she was shouting help him" help him!.<br><br>
          and i was laying on the ground.<br> that was the last scene i
          could remember. that image was running on my mind . that
          last movement was not so clear and also something missing in
          it. it was impossible for me to remember the missing one in
          it. <br><br>the real thing which unfocused my brain was why i
          couldn't recognize my face but instead of those two people.
          so that give me a clear description for me ,that the two
          person took major please in my past.my next doubt was. how
          did i live this many days without food.but i don't have any
          answer for it.<br><br> CLICK STORY BOOK in the menu to Read BOOK...</p><br><br><br>
